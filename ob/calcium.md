# Calcium deficiency noted in Peyote WIFI after topping

The cannabis plant has grown parabolically after topping. The other candidate of the same species (3 total) was... ultimately not trimmed. To note that Ca is used in bones. Following the topping, the first two leaves showed a calcium deficiency, consuming up to half of the length of the leaf. Ca seems to have been called for -- the leaf was brittle and snapped when I handled it. I must invent a prosthetic; if only I had taken the weight of the leaf (yet this would have to be known in proportion to the weight of all plant matter above it -- that is to say, the sum of the gravitational vector acting on all discrete points, in relation to the taproot. fortify the 'skeleton' of a variety of eukaryotic structures. Proportional to distribution in its leaf size, the force 
Because the calcium deficiency was noted after the plant had been topped -- the plant anticipated its eventual, lateral growth, and began to fortify+stabilize its root leaves -- a calcium deficiency thereafter manifested.
