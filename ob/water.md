# Dehydration
1. Leaves get smaller. In what amount, according to "exposure time", is unknown. We would only need to know this if nobody at all could care for the plants, or if hydration were not automated.
2. The plants nearest the humidifier wilt dramatically. 
3. It takes only a day to correct dehydration.
