# April 7th
We did a terribly loud and stressful transfer yesterday; we cut open the planters in order to free the root-bound soil. Worked out very well, except for the transfer of the tallest Peyote; cut quite a bit of the root zone along the edge where it was most concentrated(whoops). The thing to watch for now: will the tallest peyote be slower in its development? Will it continue to outpace the other two? What will happen to the leaf color? The tallest plant had the whitest roots of all. They collected at the furthest point from the stem. 

# What's the relation between topping and roots?
How does root development change when a plant is topped? I should infer upon seeing a difference in the root systems of two plants, one topped the other not, that topping manifests an apparent change in the roots. Then the mechanics of the roots can be investigated in the two cases, and the soil prepared and optimized for fulfillment of their role in the latter case (topped).
