# April 7th
We did a terribly loud and stressful transfer yesterday; we cut open the planters in order to free the root-bound soil. Worked out very well, except for the transfer of the tallest Peyote; cut quite a bit of the root zone along the edge where it was most concentrated(whoops). The thing to watch for now: will the tallest peyote be slower in its development? Will it continue to out-pace the other two? What will happen to the leaf color? To find the rule of root development. The tallest plant certainly had the whitest roots at the extremity of the soil, which is due to high concentration at that remote place. The roots collected furthest away from the stem.
