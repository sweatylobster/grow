# PAR mapping

The problem of PAR mapping is as follows: with the least number of lights, to ensure uniform distribution of optimal PPFD. Stated arithmetically, kWh/DLI. This is a conic geometrical problem. Solutions: cylindrical tubes convey photons to the plant; filters to effectively create spotlights. The two can be combined to form a retractable, aluminum-coated cylinder which has an adjustable cone at the end. Angle markings must be included. The problem then would be powering the LEDs which spread out in a cone. Alternatively, there could be LED domes which have built-in mist devices, placed over drainage grates. Local, discrete PPFD and humidity controls. Possibly with rudimentary hydraulics: press a lever down on dome enclosing plant, 'bag' fills with displaced water and pushes the LEDs closer to the plant, uniformly.
