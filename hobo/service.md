# Weed business is meaningful, but service is more meaningful.

The homeless population in LA is growing. I want to serve the community; I disapprove of society -- that people with means, do nothing. This ignorance belongs to a very low ecological consciousness, which is politically unsustainable. "My means are secured -- I can live my life." Philosophy directs the acting mind. Therefore, because of my higher ecological awareness, I want to serve the LA homeless population. 

# How

I plan to use a portion of the money I make from my business  (selling organic weed in bulk to ambitious, profit-seeking hustlers) to do a monthly dank food drive. We'll figure out how much food we can make, and how inexpensive we can get it if we buy in bulk. I plan on making a very filling pasta with tons of protein and love. Like my salmon, olive, buttered mushroom, caramelized onion, artichoke, caper, Arabbiata pasta. Then we'll buy 59-page notebooks which "Joe's Bros" are gonna fill halfway with their own doodles (maybe one bro per week for all four bros) leaving the other half (30pp) for the homeless to fill over the month. They can write, draw, make a poem, create symbols -- they just have to leave behind a gentle legacy and know that this will be a conversation.


# Inscription
All notebooks will bear the following on the inner flap:

"If you sell, monetize, or profit from this materially, fuck you. Sincerely. Fuck. You. We are white blood cells. We serve one another and manifest higher ecological consciousness. Our project is to secure the legacy of the human voice in the 21st century, the most imbalanced and senseless age the Sun has witnessed of us yet, unblinking. To do this, we create art that speaks through silence, through barriers, through mass repression. By this, and this alone, we win back what is holy within mankind. Towards the elevation of our scared and sacred species."
