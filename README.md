# grow
To automate the optimization of any grow operation.

# automation
All conditional statements have SI units for IO. This allows for ready adoption of experimentally validated findings. If a paper has compellingly argued that certain quanta, (e.g. PPFD, VPD, CO2 concentration), determine desirable outcomes, we just specify our target. Routines are selected which create a harmonic system, so that the automation does not wildly cycle certain machines on/off, on/off... all mathematical identities which would compose the system have fixed ratios with respect to each other -- these are analogous to musical intervals. Like this, certain relationships can stay the same while others differ. Output is a voltage-regulated routine of a machine whose action will affect the value, in a known proportion, of any SI unit whatever, whose change is effected to bring about the quantity specified by the conditional statement. 

# (eventual) features
1. CV*ML -> inference of nutrient deficiency
2. raw inputs -> VPD control
The primary optical evaluation of the plants is slated to be one of the inputs, even discrete nutrient programs (per plant) can be determined by conditional statements. 'Assessment' and 'correction' is the pragmatic translation of the terms 'input' and 'output'. Measurements fall under one of two categories: discrete or ambient.
