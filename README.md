The input is *always* a binary representation of a known SI quantity; this allows for easy implementation of validated findings. If these identities, base or derived, are indistinguishable from that of an SI unit, outputs of conditional statements are representations of SI units. All conditional statements have SI units for IO. Input is an observation recorded in a voltage, translated into a voltage-schema perfectly mimetic of SI units. Output is a voltage-regulated routine of a machine whose action will affect the value, in a known proportion, of any SI unit whatever, whose change is effected to bring about the quantity specified by the conditional statement. 

# (eventual) features
1. CV*ML -> inference of nutrient deficiency
2. raw inputs -> VPD control
The primary optical evaluation of the plants is slated to be one of the inputs, even discrete nutrient programs (per plant) can be determined by conditional statements. 'Assessment' and 'correction' is the pragmatic translation of the terms 'input' and 'output'. Measurements fall under one of two categories: discrete or ambient.
