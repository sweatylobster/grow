# Elements a cannabis plant requires in its soil

1. Nitrogen, 
2. Potassium,
3. Phosphorous.

The minor nutrients are:
1. Calcium,
2. Iron,
3. Sulfur,
4. Zinc,
5. Boron,
6. Manganese,
7. Copper.

Here goes the section where we say how we can tell WITH OUR EYEBALLS what nutrients our lady requires. Perhaps(!) even those amounts in which she needs them *forthwith!*

# Quantities, rates?

How much of each of the specified elements is required, *on average*? We need quite the sample size to determine this, and data is wanting since people are either lazy or secretive. Hopefully, secretive has nothing to do with glands here.

# Labor?

Determining yield *a priori* renders a ***MASSIVE*** facility. Just run "op.py", and be amazed. Nothing that can't be handled... it's just, serious man-power is required. If we do a 3-dimensional facility, how high up are we gonna go? Adjusting light height would have to be automated, water distribution too. The problem with employees anyway is that they have to "show up." But they don't. And they need to eat. But they don't. Worst of all, they complain about you not paying them. In short: there is no reason I should hire a human being. Human labor is overrated anyway. No employees!

# Automation

I/O = Input is measurement, output is control. There are two classes of measurement: discrete and ambient. An example of a discrete measurement is PPM of electrolytes in soil runoff, or the optical measurement of a plant. Nutrients go into *their* soil, after all. And ambient measurements: temp, humidity, CO2, are determined for *locales*. Appropriate automation of deeds requires the measurement which our program will take as input. The program embodies the character of judgment, which executes a the deed specified by the "then" in a conditional statement flow (if condition, to do pragma). In other words, the input is read into the form anticipated by a conditional statement, whereupon the output is converted into a pragmatic action of a machine *in that quantity specified* by the conditional statement. Since optical evaluation of the plants is one of the inputs, even discrete nutrient programs (per plant) can be determined by conditional statements. It might be inefficient to build a machine which will assemble the discrete elements which are specified by the conditional statement's output. In all cases: there is a model that the inputs map to. The outputs compensate for the input read via actions performed or directed. Whether via a human hand, or a machinic apparatus: upon arithmetic measurement of parameters, to compensate for the arithmetical difference between input values and pre-determined "ideal" values as prescribed by the model. The "ideal" in this case: can a per-plant model, given certain inputs, assemble in a statistical model the parameters which predict plant growth? Yes: this is the meaning of a statistical inference model after all. Machine "learning." What is the mathematical underpinning of such a technique?

# ...Human labor, after all
Well, transferring plants from their seedling pots to their vegetative pots, (but certain grow setups don't require this anyway). Phenotype examination (if ML is undeployed/inadequate -- i.e., "a bitch" -- or the exhaustive-quantity-of-cameras is c-o-s-t-l-y). 

# Costs

The cyclical ones are electricity, maintenance, seeds + soil, real-estate. The one-time expenses are the electrical devices.

1. How much does ventilation cost?/year
2. How much does soil cost?/cycle
3. How much do lights cost?/year

#Enabled questions
Given PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, in units of PPFD (umol/m^2 * s), to convert it into DLI(mol/m^2 * day), and then: how to optimize DLI for electricty costs?

1. What is the ratio of yield value to light costs? (per cycle)
2. What is the ratio of yield value to ventilation costs? (per cycle)
3. What is the ratio of yield value to electricity costs?
