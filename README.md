# grow
Reusable functions for assisting the imagination!
For an arithmetically-guided grow operation.

# Why Github lol
Might help someone? Other than me. Also I have two computers.

# Guiding questions
What quantity of soil is required, and in what mix ratio, to get one cannabis plant the nutrients it requires (and not much more)?
  -Weight-per-plant(kg), density(g/cm^3), pH, H20-retention (kg/t), nutrients (g), etc. of this soil?
How much do you want to grow, and, based on that, what does the facility look like? You going vertical? --> Square foot requirements.
How the fuck am I gonna grow all this shit?
How the fuck am I gonna sell all this shit?
  (these two can be solved with Don Quijote's counsel to Sancho Panza when he emerges from the cave, Sancho thinking (finally) that his master's gone crazy. I think DQ says):
  "You only don't think it's possible because you aren't experienced in the ways of the world." / "por que no estas experimentado en las cosas del mundo."
  I get chills, man. GME TO THE FUCKING MOON

# Automation
Determining yield *a priori* renders a ***MASSIVE*** facility. Nothing that can't be handled, it's just serious man-power is required.
But ugh... Employees show up. Or don't. Or eat. Or don't. Or have bad days. Or complain about you not paying them. Etc. 
Human labor is overrated anyway. Plus, work comp will kill me. No employees!

What actions are the most suitable for automation?
  -Watering, lights, ventilation. Isn't that all of the actions? What can't be automated?
  -Optical evaluation, comparison (ML-type stuff)
  -Measurement of parameters (humidity, temperature, soil weight, 
  
# ...Human labor, after all
Well, 
-transferring plants from their seedling pots to their vegetative pots, (if we actually do this)
-examining plants (if ML is undeployed/inadequate -- i.e., "a bitch" -- or the exhaustive-quantity-of-cameras is c-o-s-t-l-y)
-measurement, I guess? (--of what quantities?)
Never mind -- I don't think there's much of a need to employ anyone. 


# Costs

CYCLICAL
  -electricity
  -maintenance
  -soil
  -facility real-estate
ONE-TIME
  -electrical devices

How much does ventilation cost?/year
How much does soil cost?/cycle
How much do lights cost?/year

#Enabled questions
Given PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, in units of PPFD (umol/m^2 * s), to convert it into DLI(mol/m^2 * day), and then:
how to optimize DLI for electricty costs?

What is the ratio of yield value to light costs? (per cycle)
What is the ratio of yield value to ventilation costs? (per cycle)
What is the ratio of yield value to electricity costs?
