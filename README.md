# grow
For an arithmetically-guided grow operation.

# Why Github lol
I have two computers.

# Guiding questions
What quantity of soil, in what mix ratio, is required to get one cannabis plant juuuuust the nutrients it requires? No more, no less.
  -Typical weight(kg), density(g/cm^3), pH, H20-retention (kg/t), nutrients (g), etc. of this soil
How much do you want to grow, and, based on that, what does the facility look like? You going vertical? --> Square foot requirements.
How the fuck am I gonna grow all this shit?
How the fuck am I gonna sell all this shit?
  (these two can be solved with Don Quijote's counsel to Sancho Panza when he emerges from the cave, Sancho thinking (finally) that his master's gone crazy. I think DQ says):
  "You only don't think it's possible because you aren't experienced in the ways of the world." / "por que no estas experimentado en las cosas del mundo."
  I get chills, man. GME TO THE FUCKING MOON

# Automation
Determining yield *a priori* renders a ***MASSIVE*** facility. Nothing that can't be handled, it's just serious man-power is required.
Well, it kinda can't be handled -- how are people gonna water plants that are 14 feet off the ground, 24 times...? In what amount of time? Jesus.
Furthermore: employees have to "show up." But they don't. They need to eat. But they don't. Worst of all, they complain about you not paying them. 
There is no reason I should hire a human being. Human labor is overrated anyway. No employees!

What actions are the most suitable for automation?
  -Watering, lights, ventilation. Isn't that all of the actions? What can't be automated?
  -Optical evaluation, comparison to other members of the same strain (ML-type stuff) ( program input )
  -Measurement of parameters (humidity, temperature, weight, PPFD, CO_2)
  
# ...Human labor, after all
Well, 
-transferring plants from their seedling pots to their vegetative pots, (but certain grow setups don't require this anyway)
-phenotype examination (if ML is undeployed/inadequate -- i.e., "a bitch" -- or the exhaustive-quantity-of-cameras is c-o-s-t-l-y)
-measurement, I guess? (--of what quantities?)
Never mind -- I don't think there's much of a need to employ anyone. 


# Costs

CYCLICAL
  -electricity
  -maintenance
  -soil
  -facility real-estate
ONE-TIME
  -electrical devices

How much does ventilation cost?/year
How much does soil cost?/cycle
How much do lights cost?/year

#Enabled questions
Given PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, in units of PPFD (umol/m^2 * s), to convert it into DLI(mol/m^2 * day), and then:
how to optimize DLI for electricty costs?

What is the ratio of yield value to light costs? (per cycle)
What is the ratio of yield value to ventilation costs? (per cycle)
What is the ratio of yield value to electricity costs?
