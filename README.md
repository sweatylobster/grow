# automation
The practical meaning of an automated system is its be practically indistinguishable from judgment.  Where input is a recorded observation (electrical action in strict proportion with sensation), output is a sensible result. Numbers Criteria and conditional statements create for man an analogy between sensation and The input is *always* a binary representation of a known SI quantity; this allows for rapid integration of practices whose empirical validity has been determined by a peer-reviewed journal. This enables outputs of conditional statements to be always rational to SI units. This is essential for quantifying the effect which a routine is to have on the system. All conditional statements have SI units at both ends. To recap: where input is a recorded observation (in SI units), output is a pragmatic, voltage-controlled routine of a machine *in that quantity specified* by the conditional statement. 

# (eventual) features
1. CV*ML -> inference of nutrient deficiency
2. raw inputs -> VPD control
The primary optical evaluation of the plants is slated to be one of the inputs, even discrete nutrient programs (per plant) can be determined by conditional statements. 'Assessment' and 'correction' is the pragmatic translation of the terms 'input' and 'output'. Measurements fall under one of two categories: discrete or ambient.
