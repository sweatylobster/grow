# grow
Machine learning model for use in plant-growth experiments.

# X : Bruce Bugbee's Nine Cardinal Parameters
1. ABOVE GROUND: Temperature, humidity, wind, CO2. 
2. BELOW GROUND: Root-zone temp, nutrients, oxygen, water.

# Approach
Since plant growth is physical, pragmatic physics proposes a method of cultivation. Statistical inference of the environment under measurement will emend the plan. Plant growth will be stated as a machine learning problem, where the user selects the target variable.

# Questions
1. Is one type of machine learning problem preferable to another? 
2. Are there algorithms which will tend to outperform others, if only the data is prepared a certain way?
3. Would it be beneficial to create schemas for preparing data for the ready adaptation by a variety of models?

# TODO
1. Determine method of taking periodic measurements.
2. Convey measurements into a table.
3. Determine the target from the dataset.
4. Specify mode of inferring yield. (difference of weights)
