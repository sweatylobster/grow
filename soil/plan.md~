# Master Mark's Program

We have this google doc resource to guide the grow, but is it enough? To grow well, of course. For quantitative predictions, hardly. Our framework must arithmetically describe the relation between PPFD and nutrient exhaustion. What's required to do this?

We need quantity of nutrients, and we can use PPM. In fact, the doc mentions the use of PPM to measure run-off for concentration of nutrients. Whether we want to use PPM ultimately depends on whether it's more _convenient_ to adopt, than say, mol mol^-1. PPM is a non-dimensional unit -- so we can do whatever units we want, which is not for the best; PPM being general doesn't elucidate its use case. 

# Back to Bruce: The Nine Cardinal Parameters

To list them once again, they are:

AMBIENT:
1. TEMP
2. HUMIDITY
3. WIND
4. CO2

SOIL:
1. ROOT-ZONE TEMP
2. NUTRIENTS
3. OXYGEN
4. WATER

Bruce's work shows that PPFD drives the growth cycle. Yield is directly related to DLI. Furthermore, the relationship between efficiency and DLI is linear. We're left wondering, however, what the relation between PPFD and nutrient exhaustion is. That is: what quantities in soil are directly proportional to yield? The ratio of PPFD : H20 | C02 exhaustion is also entirely unknown. The most significant emendation of Bruce's work which lies to us to perform is:

1. Quantifying soil constituents in SI units.
   1. noting that percentages eventually give grams,
   2. g(nutrient)/g(soil) is our preliminary unit.
   3. What device enables direct measurement of particular soil constituents?
   4. This will enable quantifying plant metabolism when we compare start values (of our unit of choice) to run-off values (in identical units).  
2. Showing the relation between PPFD|DLI : 


Really, what we want is to quantify is each the plant's qualitatively distinguishable metabolic events. This must be exhaustively, empirically verified if we expect the quantities to have inferential power. Is this beyond our power? Well, is there not already a qualitative theory of plant metabolism, associated with quantities of metabolic products, in known relations? There must be. So what's left for us to determine is the change in quantities determined by the qualitatively distinguishable metabolic events. 

# Measurement devices

Welp. Here we run into an issue of cost-effectiveness. I'm kinda sick of buying things.
