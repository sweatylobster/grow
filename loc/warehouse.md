# PAR mapping

The problem of PAR mapping is as follows: with the least number of lights, to ensure uniform distribution of optimal PPFD. Stated arithmetically, kWh/DLI. This is a conic geometrical problem. Solutions: cylindrical tubes convey photons to the plant; filters to effectively create spotlights. The two can be combined to form a retractable, aluminum-coated cylinder which has an adjustable cone at the end. Angle markings must be included. The problem then would be powering the LEDs which spread out in a cone. Alternatively, there could be LED domes which have built-in mist devices, placed over drainage grates. Local, discrete PPFD and humidity controls. Possibly with rudimentary hydraulics: press a lever down on dome enclosing plant, 'bag' fills with displaced water and pushes the LEDs closer to the plant, uniformly.

# Davide grow

The space taken up by a cannabis plant is determined by PPFD(red) and stress training. Because the leaves receive the photosynthetically active range of photons, the area taken up by the leaves is the value which the area in PPFD must approach for maximum kWh efficiency (of the light producing this PPFD). This means that conical lights must be used only when the plants are undergoing stress training — other applications are inefficient. Because seedlings can be enclosed, they can be safely placed outside, while maintaining humidity, without risk of being damaged by elements or insects; this effectively eliminates electricity costs for the seedling phase, if no small-scale COB LEDs are used in tandem with the sun. Even if we prefer not to place them outside, efficiency demands that we treat the seedlings uniquely, since they do not have the canopy surface area, enabled by stress training, to warrant the use of conical lights.

# Rooms: Three

Because determining the space that we have is impossible (I’m out of the loop, Davide’s a noob, nobody knows what they’re doing), it’s most beneficial to come up with a ratio of the different rooms to each other. 

# NCR

For example, the nursery/clone room (NCR) should take no more than a third of the total facility; they're conjoined because their environmental requirements are practically identical. The NCR must be made of a material that “keeps” humidity well, for lack of a clearer, more technical verb. Wood and drywall: no-go. Concrete slabs, on the other hand, seem perfectly appropriate. Should the material be able to, in extreme cases, form condensation? Is this correlated with highest efficiency of env. control devices? The wattage of the humidifier, ventilation, and fridge must be summed for this room — are there other components?

# Logistic, Ecological, + Pharmacological (LEP)

Farms. Composting. Discrete monitoring of plants enables us to determine nutrition plans discretely. Eventually, a robust mix will emerge which reduces the need for discrete nutrient plans/tinkering. Inference (statistical or otherwise) of the quantity of nutrient deficiencies is possible. Even if we can accurately infer the quantities (and, obviously, identities) of nutrient deficiency, the schedule for administering nutrients must be verified experimentally; Pharmacology is diagnosis and treatment plan.

# Main

The main room divides into the number of sections that require unique light cycles, and different stress training approaches. If it's a good idea to separate them into vegetative and flowering, the main room divides into two sections. In any case, each section encloses a space subject to different: lighting conditions, stress-training methods. The value of the one should match as closely as possible the value of the other, for the reasons stated above.
