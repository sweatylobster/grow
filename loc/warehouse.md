# PAR mapping

The problem of PAR mapping is as follows: with the least number of lights, to ensure most uniform distribution of optimal PPFD. This is a conic geometrical problem. Efficiency(E) is defined as:

1. E = (PPF * 1/canopy_area) 
2. where E is approaching sum value of PPFD

In plain English, make sure the canopy and only the canopy gets the juice. TGL Cypress style lights...

# Efficiency: the seedling phase.

The space taken up by a cannabis plant is determined by PPFD(red) and stress training. Because it is the leaves receiving PAR, seedlings with small leaves must have different lighting considerations. They do not make a canopy. This means that conical lights must be used only when the plants are undergoing stress training, since other applications are inefficient. Because seedlings can be enclosed, they might with low hazard be placed outside, while maintaining humidity, and avoiding insects. This effectively eliminates electricity costs for the seedling phase. Small-scale COB LEDs might be used in tandem with the sun. Even if it is preferable to avoid placing them outside, efficiency demands that we treat the seedlings uniquely, since they do not have the canopy surface area, enabled by stress training, to warrant the use of conical lights.


# NCR

The nursery/clone room (NCR) should be conjoined because their environmental requirements are practically identical. The NCR must be made of a material that keeps humidity well. Wood and drywall: no-go. Concrete slabs, on the other hand, seem perfectly appropriate. Should the material be able to, in extreme cases, form condensation? Algae must not be allowed to develop in large quantities. There may be grow media which control for this. To select a material of the room correlated with highest efficiency of env. control devices? The wattage of the humidifier, ventilation, and fridge must be summed for this room. Are there other components?

# Logistic, Ecological, + Pharmacological (LEP)

A room for composting, logistics, and treatment. Discrete monitoring of plants enables us to determine nutrition plans discretely. Eventually, a (statistically) robust mix will emerge which reduces the need for discrete nutrient plans/tinkering. To infer (statistically, or otherwise) the quantity of nutrient deficiencies: possible on what model, and by what method? Independent of accuracy: (inference of quantities and identities of nutrient deficiency) -- the schedule for administering nutrients must be verified experimentally; pharmacology is both diagnosis and treatment plan. Are they not both necessarily experimental?

# Main

The main room divides into that number of stages of plant growth requiring unique light cycles. We may also create another type of division in testing different stress training approaches. This is to ensure highest kWh efficiency.
